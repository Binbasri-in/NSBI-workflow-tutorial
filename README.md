# Neural Simulation-Based Inference Workflow demonstration

The notebooks presented here aim to serve as a scaled-down and simplified tutorial for the workflow building related to the NSBI analysis recently published by ATLAS:

<br/>

- An implementation of neural simulation-based inference for parameter estimation in ATLAS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01600)
  
<br/>

- Measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production in the $H\to ZZ \to 4\ell$ decay channel using a neural simulation-based inference technique in 13 TeV p-p collisions with the ATLAS detector (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01548)

The aim is to demonstrate the workflow associated with a full-scale LHC analysis. The physics results presented in the notebooks only serve as examples of the workflow.

**Note: The tutorial is a significantly scaled down and incomplete version of the original workflow. More complete versions will follow!**

The workflow currently uses the ttbar open data released by CMS, more open datasets will be added in the future. A more complete version with systematic uncertainties and ensemble training will also be added.
