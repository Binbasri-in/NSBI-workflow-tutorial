# A simplified workflow for Neural Simulation-Based Inference

A simple and significantly scaled-down tutorial demonstrating the end-to-end workflow used in the off-shell Higgs boson analysis published by ATLAS. 

The workflow currently uses the ttbar open data released by CMS, more open datasets will be added in the future. A more complete workflow with systematic uncertainties and ensemble training will also be added.

Workflow bluprint (**tentative**):
